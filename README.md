### How to change the theme: <br/>
###### (Windows and Linux)
Just in case anyone doesn't know how to do it, here's how you can change the theme: <br/>
- Open Dolphin (duh.)
- Locate the "Options" tab on the menu bar (the one on the top) and click on it.
- Select "Configuration".
- On the new menu that just popped up, head over to the "Interface" tab and click the slider menu next to "Theme" (the bar).
- If everything on the previous guide was done correctly, you should be able to see your new theme/s there, now click it, and let your eyes enjoy the pleasure of a new theme for Dolphin ^^.

<br/>

###### (MacOS)
(The MacOS version does not have the menu bar)
- Open Dolphin
- Locate the "Config" button on the top bar and click on it.
- On the new menu that just popped up, head over to the "Interface" tab and click the slider menu next to "Theme" (the bar).
- If everything on the previous guide was done correctly, you should be able to see your new theme/s there, now click it, and you'll have a brand-spanking new theme to gaze at for hours... or at least until you decide what to play ^^.
