# *Cleanexxed*
## Icon theme for Dolphin Emulator.

### What is Cleanexxed?
Cleanexxed is an icon theme for the Dolphin Emulator that aims to keep the user interface easy to understand, whilst adapting the icons to make them simpler, to suit the modern times.

<br/>

### System Requirements  <br/>
###### (Same as regular ol' Dolphin)

- OS
    - Windows (7 SP1 or higher).
    - Linux.
    - macOS (10.12 Sierra or higher).
    - Unix-like systems other than Linux are not officially supported but might work.
- Processor
    - A CPU with SSE2 support.
    - A modern CPU (3 GHz and Dual Core, not older than 2008) is highly recommended.
- Graphics
    - A reasonably modern graphics card (Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 3.3).
    - A graphics card that supports Direct3D 11.1 / OpenGL 4.4 is recommended.

### How to install:
Installation is simple, here's how it's done: <br/> 
- Download the code from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Humanoidear/Cleanexxed) by clicking Code -> Download ZIP.
- Extract it using the windows explorer or any software you got lying aroind (WinRAR, 7zip...).
- Locate the Cleanexxed/ Cleanexxed Lite folder (depending on which color theme you want to use).
- Navigate to the location that contains your dolphin executable (dolphin.exe).
- Head over to Sys -> Themes and move the folder/s inside it. 
- Restart Dolphin (if it was already open) for it to recognize the fancy new themes you just copied.

### How to change the theme:
Just in case anyone doesn't know how to do it, here's how you can changw the theme: <br/>
- Open Dolphin (duh.)
- Locate the "Options" tab on the menu bar (the one on the top) and click on it.
- Select "Configuration".
- On the new menu that just popped up, head over to the "Interface" tab and click the slider menu next to "Theme" (the bar).
- If everything on the previous guide was done correctly, you should be able to see your new theme/s there, now click it, and have fun ^^.
